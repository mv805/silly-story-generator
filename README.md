# Silly Story Generator!
###### [from the MDN Web Development Course (Javascript Fundamentals)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Silly_story_generator)

This is my solution to the simple excersize where a random silly 'mad libs' style story is generated after each click of the randomize button. 

See my [live page](https://mv805.github.io/silly-story-generator/) to try it out!
